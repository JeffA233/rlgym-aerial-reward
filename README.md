# rlgym-aerial-reward
Short summary:
The motivation for this reward was to try to promote aerial plays from anywhere on the field including on walls. I wanted to try to create a reward that I would also not need to adjust the weight of so this is a trial of sorts at providing a self-normalizing reward which should never need a weight adjustment. It should hopefully be documented enough in code to be readable.
